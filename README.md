# Activating the environment

`$ source activate`

# Connecting to Peter's PC

1. Turn on VPN
2. `ssh marnix@134.184.26.35`
3. [optional via Files: connect to `sftp://134.184.26.35` with VPN enabled]

# Possible improvements

- Only use JAX random generator, right now we mix with `np.random.state`
- Use coherent white space (now it's a mess due to Jupyter Lab)
